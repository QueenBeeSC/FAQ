### Swarm City Project  
---

<br>


<details><summary>What is Swarm City?</summary>

A global network building a decentralized app, built on the Ethereum blockchain, to create a [community](https://medium.com/arcade-city-press/getting-organized-62b91a7a0541) of open marketplaces for the exchange of services between peers. Learn more [here](https://queenbeesc.github.io/swarm.city/)
</details>


<details><summary>How did the project begin?</summary>

This project started as a [crazy idea](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/11/09/arcade-city-decentralized-p2p-services-platform-announces-ico/) to cut out the middlemen between rideshare drivers and passengers. The idea attracted a swarm of contributors that organically strengthened the effort by using Facebook networks to free drivers from both the corporate giants and unnecessary regulations with open peer-2-peer interactions, and eventually attracted some Ethereum developers. Which led to the crowdsale, a [brand fork](https://press.swarm.city/forking-a-brand-cde5de87d46a), and new [business leader](https://press.swarm.city/happy-new-year-a52f80043cc7) to carry the project to the next level, a truly [decentralized platform](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/02/20/launch-swarm-city-terminal/)

</details>

<details><summary>How are people using Swarm City for ridesharing before it's available in the app?</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Is the Swarm City app open source?</summary>

Yes, Swarm City is an open-source P2P web application platform, providing decentralized, privacy-preserving software which keeps users in control of their own content. [Github](https://github.com/swarmcity)
</details>

<details><summary>Will the Swarm City app be downloadable in the playstore?</summary>

No, we have decided against listing the Swarm City app in the Google or Apple appstores. We are creating a Decentralized App (DApp), we do not want to create limitations to suit Google or Apple guidelines. This [book](https://books.google.com/books?id=CEsPDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT140&lpg=PT140&dq=can+you+list+a+decentralized+app+in+the+app+stores&source=bl&ots=gxpXgTRhcb&sig=dzk4uYfnXfWMOSOVLm6kQNDYsdM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQh-e0kcTTAhXBjVQKHdCeD18Q6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&q=can%20you%20list%20a%20decentralized%20app%20in%20the%20app%20stores&f=false) describes why
</details>

<details><summary>What is a DApp?</summary>

Decentralized Apps (DApps) are a new type of software program designed to exist on the Internet in a way that is not controlled by any single entity. No central servers, no data collection. See the explanations given on the [Ethereum stack exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/383/what-is-a-dapp)

</details>

<details><summary>How do I get SWT?</summary>

The best way to buy SWT is from an exchange 
[Changelly](https://changelly.com)

</details>

You can either hold on to them for novelty sake or exchange them for SWT in the [Terminal](https://swarm.city)
</details>

<details><summary>Why do I need to exchange tokens?</summary>

For the benefit of this project it was necessary to fork the brand from Arcade City to Swarm City. However, we wanted to make sure the brand fork did not impact Arcade City token owners. The last step to completing our rebranding process is upgrading our token to the [Swarm City Token]https://github.com/swarmcity/sc-token/blob/master/token-exchange-miniwhitepaper.md)(SWT)
</details>

<details><summary>What can I use SWT for?</summary>

All transactions that occur within the Swarm CIty DApp will happen on the Ethereum blockchain, users exchange SWT, an ERC 20 token
</details>


<details><summary>Why the brand fork?</summary>

There are 2 key reasons for the brand fork, the ARC symbol was already in use by some other coins and the previous token contract cannot be renamed and would not have suited the new branding
</details>

<details><summary>When can I start the exchange process?</summary>

You can start the exchange anytime, [enter here]( https://swarm.city/)    
</details>

<details><summary>Is there a time limit on exchanging ARC to SWT?</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Is there any way I can I exchange ARC tokens for SWT without using the Terminal swap feature?</summary>

Yes, the easiest way is to use the Terminal but users can perform the exchange manually, find directions [here]( https://github.com/swarmcity/sc-token/blob/master/token-exchange-miniwhitepaper.md#options-for-exchanging-my-tokens)
</details>

You will need to import your MyEtherWallet to the Terminal by pasting the private key. You will be guided through the token exchange process, which should only take a few minutes to execute. Once done, you can always watch the SWT on your [MyEtherWallet](https://myetherwallet.com) account as well as in the Terminal
</details>

<details><summary>Can I send ARC directly from MyEtherWallet to the SWT contract?</summary>

No, to exchange from ARC to SWT you will have paste to your private key from MyEtherWallet to Terminal and use the exchange tool in Terminal. Once complete, you will be able to view your SWT on your [MyEtherWallet](https://myetherwallet.com) account as well as in the Terminal

</details>

<details><summary>How can I trade SWT with other users?</summary>

Users can send tokens with a public address or shortcode or any crypto exchange that lists SWT
</details>

<details><summary>Can I mine SWT?</summary>

No, you can't mine SWT. We held a crowdsale from Nov. 1 to Nov. 30, 2016. SWT was offered for sale to the public. There were 9,525,397.92198459159306133876 SWT minted to be traded on the platform
</details>

<details><summary>How many SWT will be minted?</summary>

The total number of SWT in circulation will be determined by how many ARC tokens get converted to SWT. If only 5,000,000 ARC tokens are converted into SWT, there will only be 5,000,000 SWT in circulation. Most notably there will be no extra tokens minted. A total of 9,525,397.921984591306133876 ARC tokens were minted, so at most only 9,525,397 SWT can ever be minted. This number includes the 16% tokens minted in addition to the ARC token sale.

</details>

<details><summary>What happens with the Ether that was raised through the Arcade City token sale?</summary>

Therefore, we will continue to use the [ether](https://etherscan.io/address/0x50126e8fcb9be29f83c6bbd913cc85b40eaf86fc) for building the sharing economy platform. You can also follow the progress of the project in the Swarm City Medium channel, [end of April update](https://press.swarm.city/swarm-city-dev-update-april-25-2017-3bb0cf9348cf)
