Question | Answer 
-------- | ------
<h5 id="whatIsSWT">What is a Swarm City Token (SWT)?</h5> | The SWT is a utility to pay for transactions in the Swarm City ecosystem
<h5 id="whyExchange">Why do I need to exchange tokens?</h5> | For the benefit of this project it was necessary to fork the brand from Arcade City to Swarm City. However, we wanted to make sure the brand fork did not impact Arcade City token owners. The last step to completing our rebranding process is upgrading our token to ‘Swarm City Token’ (SWT)
<h5 id="whatIsSWTfor">What can I use SWT for?</h5> | The Swarm City ecosystem will run on SWT
<h5 id="whyBrandFork">Why the brand fork?</h5> | There are 2 key reasons for the brand fork, the ARC symbol was already in use by some other coins and the previous token contract cannot be renamed and would not have suited the new branding
<h5 id="arc2swtStartExchangeProcess">When can I start the exchange process?</h5> | You can start the exchange anytime, [enter here]( https://swarm.city/)    
<h5 id="arc2swtTimeLimitExchange">Is there a time limit on exchanging ARC to SWT?</h5> | There is no time limit on performing the conversion. This functionality will be permanently available in our contract
<h5 id="arc2swtExchangeRate">What is the exchange rate?</h5> | This is a 1:1 token exchange
<h5 id="arc2swtWhereTogo">Where do I go to exchange my previously purchased ARC for SWT tokens?</h5> | You will start the exchange by going to the Swarm City Terminal, [enter here]( https://swarm.city)

<h5 id="arc2swtHowToExchangeMyetherWallet">How do I exchange the ARC tokens that are in MyEtherWallet?</h5> | You will need to import your MyEtherWallet to the Terminal by pasting the private key. You will be guided through the token exchange process, which should only take a few minutes to execute. Once done, you can always watch the SWT on your MyEtherWallet account as well as in the Terminal
<h5 id="arc2swtSendArcMyEtherWallet">Can I send ARC directly from MyEtherWallet to the SWT contract?</h5> | No, to exchange from ARC to SWT you will have paste to your private key from myether wallet to Terminal and use the exchange tool in Terminal. Once complete, you will be able to view your SWT on your MyEtherWallet account as well as in the Terminal
<h5 id="arc2swtOldWallet">How do I exchange ARC tokens purchased with the previously released ARC wallet?</h5> | [Enter here]( https://swarm.city/) and follow the steps to import your ARC wallet into the Terminal. You will be guided through the token exchange process, which should only take a few minutes to execute
<h5 id="arc2swtViewAndStore">Where can I view and store my SWT tokens after the exchange?</h5> | Upon entry to the Terminal, all users create a digital wallet. This wallet is used to view, store, send and receive the tokens you own
<h5 id="swtUseIt">When/How can I use my SWT tokens?</h5> | The Swarm City token (SWT) has been created to function within the Swarm City environment. SWT tokens will be exchanged as the only form of payment within the app 
<h5 id="swtTradeing">How can I trade SWT tokens with other users?</h5> | The SWT will be listed on exchanges, where anyone can offer or buy tokens. In the more distant future, users can easily buy tokens from USD, EUR and other fiat currencies on our in-app exchange.
<h5 id="swtMining">Can I mine SWT tokens?</h5> | No, you can't mine SWT tokens 
<h5 id="swtMinting">How many SWT tokens will be minted?</h5> | The total number of SWT in circulation will be determined by how many ARC tokens get converted to SWT. If only 5,000,000 ARC tokens are converted into SWT, there will only be 5,000,000 SWT tokens in circulation. Most notably there will be no extra tokens minted. A total of 9,525,397.921984591306133876 ARC tokens were minted, so at most only 9,525,397 SWT can ever be minted. This number includes the 16% tokens minted in addition to the ARC token sale.
<h5 id="swtICO">Will there be a Swarm City ICO?</h5> | No, there will not be a Swarm City ICO. The amount of SWT created through the token exchange will be the maximum ever created

<h5 id="swtRaisedEther">What happens with the Ether that was raised through the Arcade City token sale?</h5> | We have brand forked, but we are still actively developing the product as described in the token sale Whitepaper. Therefore, we will continue to use the ether for building the sharing economy platform. You can also follow the progress of the project in the Swarm City Medium channel.
<h5 id="swtRefund">I don't want SWT, how can I get an ether refund for what I spent buying ARC tokens?</h5> | We recommend exchanging your ARC tokens to the new SWT tokens. Only SWT will be accepted in the Swarm City ecosystem, so any ARC token holders who wish to interact with the Swarm City platform will need to exchange their ARC for SWT. We will not refund ether, but you can sell ARC token one of these decentralized exchanges: [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-SWT), [Etherdelta](https://etherdelta.github.io/#SWT-ETH), [CryptoDerivatives](https://cryptoderivatives.market/token/SWT), [Coinmarketcap](http://coinmarketcap.com/assets/swarm-city/)
<h5 id="swtMissedTokenSale">I missed the token sale, but I do want SWT, how can I buy tokens now?</h5> | The SWT will be listed on exchanges, where anyone can offer or buy tokens. In the more distant future, users can easily buy tokens from USD, EUR and other fiat currencies on our in-app exchange.
